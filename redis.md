# Redis #

Redis is a popular open-source, in-memory data structure store. It provides a fast, scalable, and flexible data store for key-value pairs, lists, sets, and more. Redis supports multiple data structures, including strings, hashes, and sorted sets. Redis provides libraries for Java and Python that allow developers to interact with Redis databases using APIs. Java can use the Jedis library, and Python can use the Redis-Py library.
