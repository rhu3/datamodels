# SQLite #

SQLite is a popular open-source and embedded SQL database engine. It provides an ACID-compliant relational database management system (RDBMS). SQLite's design is simple, small, and fast, making it a great option for embedded systems and mobile applications. SQLite's data model is based on the relational data model. SQLite provides libraries for Java and Python that allow developers to interact with SQLite databases using SQL queries and APIs. Java can use JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) libraries, and Python can use SQLite libraries such as sqlite3.
